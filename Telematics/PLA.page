title: Telematics Product Line Architecture
...

Vehicle telematics systems integrate multiple telecommunication and information processing functions in an automobile, 
such as navigation, driving assistance, emergency and warning systems, hands-free phone, and entertainment functions,
and present them to the driver and passengers via multimedia displays. 

Summary of concepts
===================

```{.clafer .summary}

Detailed model
==============

A concrete telematics system can support either
a single or two channels; two channels afford independent programming for the
driver and the passengers. The choice is represented as the xor-group
channel. By default, each channel has one associated
display; however, we can add one extra display per channel, as indicated by
the optional feature <a href="#c69_extraDisplay">extraDisplay</a>. 
Finally, we can choose <a href="#c72_large">large</a> or <a href="#c71_small">small</a> displays (displaySize).

```clafer
telematicsSystem
    xor channel
        single
        dual
    extraDisplay ?
    xor size
        small
        large
    [ dual <=> ECU2 ]
    [ extraDisplay <=> #ECU1.display = 2 ]
    [ extraDisplay <=> (ECU2 => #ECU2.display = 2) ]
    [ large <=> ! plaECU.display.options.size.small ]
    [ small <=> ! plaECU.display.options.size.large ]
```

There are two types of components: <a href="#c23_ECU">ECU</a>s (electronic control units) and <a href="#c24_display">display</a>s.
Each display has exactly one <a href="#c23_ECU">ECU</a> as its server. All components have a version.
Components themselves may have <a href="#c1_options">options</a>, like the display size or <a href="#c5_cache">cache</a>. 
We can also specify the cache size and decide whether it is <a href="#c7_fixed">fixed</a> or
can be updated dynamically. Thus, the solution space model consists of a class
model of component types and a feature model of component options.

```clafer
abstract comp
    version ->> integer
```

and the two types of components:

```clafer
abstract ECU : comp

abstract display : comp
    server ->> ECU
    `options
    [this.version >= server.version]
```

Reusable `options` are defined as follows:

```clafer
abstract options
    xor size
        small
        large
    cache ?
        size ->> integer
            fixed ?
    [small && cache => fixed]
```

The architectural meta-model is very generic: the meta-model describes infinitely
many different products, each corresponding to its particular instance. We would
like to specialize and extend the meta-model to create a particular template.
A template makes most of the architectural structure fixed, but leaves some
points of variability. 

a concrete product must have at least one ECU and thus we create
ECU1 to represent the mandatory instance. 
Then, optional instances are represented using classes with cardinality
0..1. Our product line can optionally have another ECU, represented by
ECU2.
Similarly, each ECU has either one display or two displays, but none of the
displays has cache. Besides, we need to constrain the server reference in each
display in plaECU, so that it points to its associated ECU - this constraint is nested under
display. The reference parent points to the current instance of
plaECU, which is either ECU1 or ECU2.Also, ECU2 extends the base
type with master,pointing to ECU1 as the main control unit.

```clafer 
abstract plaECU : ECU
    `display 1..2
        [server = parent ]
        [ ! options.cache]

ECU1 : plaECU

ECU2 : plaECU ?
    master ->> ECU1
```

Having defined the architectural template, we are ready to expose the remaining
variability points as a product-line feature model. 
A set of constraints coupling its features to the variability
points of the template. Note that the template allowed the number of displays
(ECU1.display and ECU2.display) and the size of every display to vary independently;
however, we further restrict the variability in the feature model, requiring
either all present ECUs to have two displays or all to have no extra display and
either all present displays to be small or all to be large. Also note that we opted
to explain the meaning of each feature in terms of the model elements to be
selected rather than defining the presence condition of each element in terms of
the features. Both approaches are available in Clafer, however.
Constraints allow us restricting a model to a single instance. The following code block shows
a top-level constraint specifying a single product, with two ECUs, two large
displays per ECU, and all components in version 1. 

```clafer
[ dual ]
[ extraDisplay ]
[ telematicsSystem.size.large ]
[ comp.version = 1 ]
```
