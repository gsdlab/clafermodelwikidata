title: ClaferWiki-Specific Help Demonstration
...

**Add a Clafer code fragment as follows:**

```clafer
abstract A
  c -> C *

A1 : A
  [ #c = 2 ]

abstract B : A

abstract C
```

**or in the full code block notation**

```{.clafer}
C1 : C

C2 : C
```

**Add a graph in the simplified notation:**

```{.clafer .graph}
```

Double click on the graph in the simplified notation to show/hide references. By default, the graph only shows inheritance relationships allowing for quick inspection of the inheritance hierarchy which is not directly visible in Clafer's textual notation. 

**Add a graph in the CVL notation:**

```{.clafer .cvlGraph}
```

**Add statistics:**

```{.clafer .stats}
```

**Add download links for a complete model file (`.cfr`) and a self-contained HTML rendering of the model file (`.html`):**

```{.clafer .links}
```

**Add summary, which includes 1) a graph in the simplified notation, 2) module statistics, and 3) the download links:**

```{.clafer .summary}
```
