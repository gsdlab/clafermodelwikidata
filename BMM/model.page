title: The Business Motivation Model
...

This model is based on "The Business Motivation Model - Business Governance in a Volatile World" by [The Business Rules Group](http://www.BusinessRulesGroup.org).

The model contains both the structural aspects based on the metamodels and semantic aspects of the concepts based on the natural language description. For example, an `End` can be `attainable`, `short`- or `long term`, and `focused on` `enterprise` or a `business area`. These properties are important for communicating the nature of the concepts and should aid the modeller in evaluating whether her model is semantically correct (e.g., a `long-term` and `unattainable` Objective 
is incorrect). These semantic properties constitute a "checklist" for the modeller.

Model Details
=============


First, we define a generic BMM model `Element`:

```clafer
abstract Element
```

There are many types of `Element`s in a BMM model but two are most important: `End`s and `Mean`s. `End`s are what an enterprise is trying to accomplish. `Mean`s are the ways of accomplishing the `End`s.

```clafer
abstract End : Element	
    attainable ?
    xor term
        short
        long
    xor focusedOn
        enterprise
        businessArea
```

and 

```clafer 
abstract Mean : Element
```

Ends
----

The `Vision` is *what* an enterprise is supposed to look like, without regard to *how* it can be achieved.

```clafer
abstract Vision : End		
    [ enterprise ]
    [ long ]
    amplifiedBy -> Goal + 		// inverseOf amplifies
    madeOperativeBy -> Mission  	// inverseOf makesOperative
```

A `DesiredResult` is a different type of `End` than the `Vision` and represents a tangible outcome that can be either `qualitative` or `quantitative`.

```clafer
abstract DesiredResult : End
    supportedBy -> CourseOfAction +
    xor kind
        qualitative
        quantitative
```

```clafer
abstract Goal : DesiredResult
    amplifies -> Vision		// inverseOf isAmplifiedBy
    general
    ongoing
    [ businessArea ]
    [ attainable ]
    [ qualitative ]
    [ long ]
    // measuresOfPerformance -> Metric +
```

```clafer
abstract Objective : DesiredResult
    SMART
        specific
        // measurable -> Metric +
        [ attainable ]
        relevant
        timeBound
    limitedInTimeframe  
        cyclical ?
    [ businessArea ]
    [ quantitative ]
    [ short ]
    quantifies -> Goal +
```

*Michal: in some particular cases different kinds of `influencer`s may be required. One could extend `Influencer` but currently, it is not possible to add clafers to its children, e.g., a new type of internalInfluencer?  *

`Assessment` is a judgement that an `influencer` affects the employment of `Mean`s or the achievement of `End`s.

```clafer
abstract Assessment : Element 
    identifies -> PotentialImpact  // inverseOf significantTo
    about -> Influencer
    or affects
        employmentOf -> Mean +
        achievementOf -> End +
    madeBy -> OrganizationUnit  // Michal: how to inject a derived inverse 'makes' into the TOGAF metamodel?
    uses -> Assessment *
    xor SWOT
        strength
        weakness
        opportunity
        threat
```

```clafer
abstract PotentialImpact : Element
    significantTo -> Assessment
    providesImpetusFor -> Directive
    xor type
        risk
            probabilityOfLoss : integer 	// in %
            potentialLoss : integer
            unitOfMeasure -> Currency			
        potentialReward
