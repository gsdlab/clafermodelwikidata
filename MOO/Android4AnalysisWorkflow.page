[Back to Introduction](/MOO/Introduction)

1. Open

[http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8091/MOO/Android4](http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8091/MOO/Android4)

and browse through the model to see what's there.

2. Click on the 

`Analyze with ClaferMooVisualizer`

link/button.

3. In the Pareto front table 

* press `Distinct`, 
* click on `USB` once to select it, 
* click on `Bluetooth` twice to eliminate it

4. Select product for analysis by clicking on the bubbles in the Pareto front graph or on the column headers in the table. 
Observe how both are synchronized.

* Make sure you have `P11` selected.

5. Now, select `WiFi` in the table. 
Notice that `P11` disappears from the graph and the table but it still remains in the analysis view.

6. In the Analysis view, if the message reads, for example

`[Not Complete], add [P2,P4,P8,P15,P17,P21,25,P26]`

* click on the `add` button to have all the suggested products added automatically.

If the message reads 

`[Complete] - The set is a complete concept`

* you can make it incomplete again by selecting another product or removing one.

6. Let's say you're not interested in `P11` anymore, 

* click on the little `x` next to `P11` in the Analysis view in the section about differences.

7. Finally, we'd like to show mass as bubble size and security as bubble opacity

* drag `total_mass` from the Goals view onto the label with two bubbles on the right of the graph showing currently `total_security`. `Total_security` will change to `total_mass`.
* drag `total_security` from the Goals view onto the label of the opacity currently showing `total_mass`. 

8. Finally, hoover your mouse on the bubbles in the graph and observe the popup and and the little triangle showing the value on the opacity label.

9. press the button `Reset` in the table to remove all filtering.

10. click on `Normal` to remove dimming.
